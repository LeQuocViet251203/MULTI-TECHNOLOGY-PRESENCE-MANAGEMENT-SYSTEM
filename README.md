# MULTI-TECHNOLOGY-PRESENCE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
This paper outlines a multi-technology presence detection solution using LoRa, Wi-Fi, and BLE to detect BLE-enabled devices and beacons present in a covered area. BLE is a wireless communication technology low in power usage that is omnipresent in IoT networks, extending interference-free coverage to wearables, smart sensors, and low-energy devices. Its application varies from smart cities, healthcare, and industrial automation to tracking efficient assets and humans for enhanced security, operational effectiveness, and emergencies.

The unit uses two Heltec LoRa32 V2 modules, a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter is always scanning its environment for BLE signals, transmitting data collected using LoRa, a low-power long-range communication technology. Simultaneously, it uses Wi-Fi to relay real-time data to ThingSpeak, an online data visualization and aggregation service. The receiver picks up LoRa broadcasts, serving as a middleman for local data collection.

By integrating LoRa’s extended communication range, Wi-Fi’s cloud connectivity, and BLE’s precise device detection, this system delivers a robust, scalable solution for industries seeking advanced presence tracking to optimize asset management, security, and operational workflows.
